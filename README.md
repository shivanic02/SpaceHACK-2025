# SpaceHACK-2025
🌍 Geospatial analysis project from SpaceHACK 2025 to address urban food insecurity in Phoenix, AZ. Leveraging satellite imagery and datasets (USDA, NASA, USGS), we identified urban agriculture sites and proposed scalable solutions like community gardens and farmers markets to enhance local food resilience. 🛰️

🛰️ Project Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis developed during SpaceHACK 2025, where our team from Arizona State University tackled the challenge of addressing food insecurity in urban areas. Our innovative solution leveraged geospatial data and satellite imagery to identify potential urban agricultural spaces in Phoenix, Arizona, with the goal of strengthening local food resilience.

🌟 Key Highlights
- Mapped Urban Agriculture Sites: Identified potential spaces for urban agriculture, targeting 12% of food-insecure households in Phoenix.

- Uncovered Gaps in Support: Found that 43% of food-insecure households are outside existing government support programs.

- Geospatial Analysis: Conducted a multi-layered analysis using datasets from:

    - USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)

    - NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration)

    - USGS (United States Geological Survey)

    - U.S. Census Bureau

- Proposed Scalable Solutions:

    - Community Gardens

    - Farmers Markets

    - Regenerative Urban Landscapes
        
- Impact Potential: Demonstrated how these interventions could reduce dependency on food imports and enhance local food resilience.

🏆 Achievements
Our project was awarded the Runner-Up Prize at SpaceHACK 2025 for its innovative approach to tackling food insecurity through space-based technologies and geospatial analysis.
